# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 

#### Water Resources Engineer (Automation)
#### RMSI Private Ltd., Noida, India 07/2022-Present
• Worked on a Research Project “Automation of HEC-RAS” with Technical Experts.
• Successfully automated one-dimensional flood model within 4 months which reduce the time for building a Flood Model by 80%.
• Implemented a comprehensive project plan as Project Lead, streamlining the automation process of HEC-RAS API using Python,
QGIS Python Scripting, and SQL; resulted in 60% reduction in manual errors and saved 60+ hours per week.
• Collaborated with software developers to integrate automated scripts, resulting in the creation of a powerful Plugin in QGIS for
HEC-RAS automation; saved an average of 20 hours per week in manual data processing tasks.
• Developing and maintaining automated test scripts using Python and QGIS Python Scripting.

#### Water Resources Engineer
#### Jomiso Consulting Private Ltd., New Delhi, India 11/2021-05/2022
• Developed HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS Flood Models for Agartala and Kailashahar within 2 months.
• Writing Technical Reports.

## Topic : Multi-dimensional Characterization of Flooding Events over Indian Peninsular Region using Machine Learning

• Analyzed Flood Dataset of Indian Peninsular region from 1965-2019 spatially and temporally using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
Geo-Pandas and folium Python libraries on IIT Delhi High Performance Computing.
• Computed Hydrologic Signatures such as Mean Annual Flow, Mean Annual Monsoon Flow, High Flow, Low Flow, Slope of
Flow Duration Curve etc. using Python for Observed Flood Dataset.
• Developed Predictive Models for 7 Hydrologic Signatures using Random Forest Algorithm

# PERSONAL PROJECTS 

## Classification with Neural Network 

Here, I will be using the famous MNIST fashion dataset, which contains 70,000 clothing fashion images. Here our task is to train an image classification model with neural networks.

### Model Building
Here, I have used neural networks to train an image classification model.

## Language Detection with Machine Learning

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document.

### Dataset
The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages.

### Model Building
As this is a problem of multiclass classification, so I have used the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm to train the language detection model as this algorithm always performs very well on the problems based on multiclass classification.


## Credit Card Clustering with Machine Learning
Credit card clustering is the task of grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many other financial factors. It is also known as credit card segmentation. Such clustering analysis helps businesses find their potential customers and many more marketing strategies. 

### Dataset
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

### Model Building
Here, I am using K-means Clustering for grouping of credit card customers . The groups formed range from 0 to 4.

##  Weather Forecasting using Python
weather forecasting is an application of Time Series Forecasting where we use time-series data and algorithms to make forecasts for a given time.With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.

### Dataset
This dataset provides data from 1st January 2013 to 24th April 2017 in the city of Delhi, India. The 4 parameters here are meantemp, humidity, wind_speed, meanpressure.

### Model Building
I have used Facebook prophet model for this task. The Facebook prophet model is one of the best techniques for time series forecasting.
